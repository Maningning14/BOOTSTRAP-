        <h1>1. What is Bootstrap?</h1>
        <p> - it is a technique of loading a program into a computer by means of a few initial instructions which enable the introduction of the rest of the program from an input device. Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.</p>
      <h1>2. Is it necessary to use Bootstrap in your web projects? </h1>
      <p> - Yes of course. Bootstrap has amazing documentation on each component. So if I want to update a project I worked on that uses Bootstrap I know where to go to find documentation if I get stuck. Also, the more I use Bootstrap the more it is burned into my brain and the less time is spent searching the docs. </p>
